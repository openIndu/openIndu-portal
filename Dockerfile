# and FAILS the build (exit 1) if no browser launches — prerendered HTML is a
# required production artifact. Puppeteer's bundled Chrome is a glibc build and
# cannot run on Alpine's musl, so install Alpine's own Chromium and point
# Puppeteer at it instead of downloading the (unusable, large) bundled one.
