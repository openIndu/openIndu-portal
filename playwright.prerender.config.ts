/**
 * Separate config for the prerender/SEO project — deliberately NOT merged
 * into playwright.config.ts's webServer array. Playwright starts every
 * entry in a `webServer` array unconditionally for any invocation of that
 * config, project filter or not; folding a production build in there
 * would make every routine `npx playwright test` run one. Run this one
 * separately (see e2e/prerender.spec.ts's header comment and
 * design/architecture/i18n-test-rework-plan.md section 4.3 — intended as
 * its own, slower CI job after the main suite).
 *
 * `npm run build` is a REQUIRED, SEPARATE step before this config, not
 * chained into webServer.command:
 *   npm run build && npx playwright test --config=playwright.prerender.config.ts
 *
 * Why not chain it (tried first, reverted): `npm run build`'s last step
 * (scripts/prerender.mjs) starts and stops its own internal preview
 * server on port 4173 to do the Puppeteer rendering. Keeping that lifecycle
 * outside Playwright's process tree makes failures easier to attribute and
 * leaves this webServer responsible only for serving the completed dist/.
 *
 * Both the server and readiness probe use an explicit IPv4 loopback address.
 * This avoids localhost resolution differences and keeps HTTP proxy settings
 * from intercepting Playwright's local readiness request.
